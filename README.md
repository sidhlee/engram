A personal tracking system for online learning materials

## Problem

- While learning to become a web developer, I had to absorb large amount of information in a relatively short period of time.
- There are some online documents and articles that I tend to revisit over time because 1. I forget 2. for deeper understanding.
- When I find some really good article, I bookmark it for later read, but when it's hidden inside bookmark folders, I don't even remember that I have them.
- I want to see all the things that I learned in one sight so hold onto the concepts and build mental map, but most of the existing solutions are not utilizing bigger screen to do that.
